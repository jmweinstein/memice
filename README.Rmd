# memice

<img src="https://github.com/jmweinstein/hex/blob/main/memice_hexsticker.png?raw=true" align="right" width="162"/>

`memice` is a package with several functions to facilitate the estimation of marginal effects in linear and generalized linear models. It takes a model object (`lm()` or `glm()` objects) and a `.mids` object (a data object containing data multiply imputed by `mice::mice()`), estimates the marginal effects in each dataset within the `.mids` object, and pools the marginal effect estimates according to Rubin's Rules. This package takes inspiration from Daniel Klein's mimrgns program for Stata.

## Installation

You can install the development version of memice like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jmweinstein/memice")
```

## Recommended workflow

The recommended workflow for using all `memice` functions is:

1.  Create your desired model with the dataset that contains missing data
2.  Use `mice::mice()` to impute data via chained equations and save to an object
3.  Call `memice::initialize_memice()` to initialize your workspace for using memice (this adds formatting functions to your workspace, which are necessary for `memice` properly handling different variable types)
4.  Use one of the `memice` functions, feeding in your model from Step 1 and your `.mids` object (from `mice::mice()`) from Step 2

Model estimation is done prior to the use of `memice` functions to ensure that all quirks with models have been figured out before being fed into any of the `memice` functions. Things that may cause issues with `memice` functions pooling marginal effects estimates include non-convergence of generalized linear models or improperly-formatted variables (numbers that should be factors, factors that should be numeric, etc.)- by estimating the model before using the `memice` functions, the user has the opportunity to identify and remedy these issues beforehand.

## Example usage of `memice::ame_mice()`

The function `memice::ame_mice()` estimates average marginal effects (AME) in multiply imputed data created by `mice::mice()`.

```{r example_1.1}
library(memice)
library(missMethods)


## Create dataset with artificially-induced missingness in 'cyl' variable
data_with_missings <- mtcars |>
  missMethods::delete_MCAR(0.3, "cyl") |>
  dplyr::mutate(cyl = as.factor(cyl))
```

Create your desired model with the dataset that contains missing data

```{r example_1.2}
lm_mod <- lm(formula = mpg ~ wt + hp + cyl + cyl*wt + disp,
             data = data_with_missings)
```

Create `.mids` object of imputed data using `mice::mice()`

```{r example_1.3}
imputation <- mice::mice(data = data_with_missings, m = 5, seed = 01701)
```

Initialize `memice` using `initialize_memice`, then estimate and pool marginal effects across the imputed datasets
```{r example_1.4}
memice::initialize_memice()
pooled_mfx <- memice::ame_mice(model = lm_mod, mice_object = imputation)
pooled_mfx
```
